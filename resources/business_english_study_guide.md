Business English Study Guide
=====

1. Complete Immersion - It is clear the optimal way to become fluent in any language is complete immersion. Yes - complete immersion is uncomfortable. It is easier to stay in a language you are already fluent in (or immediately fail back a fluent language once challenged). You have to completely let go of that crutch.

    That means communicate __only__ in Business English. Every word you say. Every word you type. When you are studying data science, study only in English. English-only notes. English-only study groups. If you have any other language keyboard installed, uninstall it.

    Have your peers hold you accountable for any slips into another language or informal slang.

1. Recording - All of us of the most powerful learning tool in the universe in our pocket - our phones. Start recording yourself speaking English, then play it back. I know - __IT SUCKS__. However, the "tape does not lie". You'll get empirical evidence exactly how you sound.

    In the Business Communication course, we'll frequently record ourselves and analyze.

1. Flashcards - Once you have identify areas for improvement through recording, it is time to drill yourself to improve. I like [Anki flashcards](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) which have the ability to play sound. I can hear the correct pronunciation, then try to mimic it. A list of English flashcards is [here](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/english). 

1. The force multiplier is recording and analyzing your Anki sessions. You can hear the delta between the correct pronunciation and your pronunciation.

If you actively and consistently do the above items, you'll be pleasantly surprised on how fast you improve.
