Each item's contribution is capped its respective percentage. The total course percentage is capped at 100%.

Currently, there is no extra credit. If there is any extra credit, it is entirely at the discretion of the instructor.

We'll be using Canvas as the learning management system (LMS), aka the gradebook. The instructional team will do their best to have Canvas accurately reflect your current scores in the course. However, Canvas may not be completely accurate all the time. In other words, your actual grade maybe significant different than it appears on Canvas. 

Note - [Canvas may localize your timezone in a way that could appear confusing](https://clt.champlain.edu/knowledgebase/canvas-time-zone-faqs-online-students/). The dues dates and times listed above are what matter.

Asking for acceptance of any late assignments without a medical emergency or submitting assignment not through Canvas will result in a loss of professionalism points (and your assignment will still not be accepted).

### Professionalism  

I expect you act professionally at all times: in-person and electronically; during class outside class. Since people come up from a variety of backgrounds, I'm explicitly defining professionalism: 

- Show up on time and prepared.
- Remain fully present.
- Contribute appropriately and meaningfully.
- Follow staff and faculty instructions appropriately.
- Show respect to all people.

Professionalism points are entirely at the instructor's discretion. 

Violations of Academic Integrity are unprofessional, thus you'll automatically lose all Professionalism points for any violations of Academic Integrity. 

Tardiness negatively impacts an active learning environment, thus will impact your professionalism grade.

You must show-up to each session prepared. Each person is important to the dynamic of the class, and therefore students are required to participate in class activities. Expect to be "cold called". I call on students at random not to put you on the spot but to keep you engaged in the material at all times.

I expect you to be fully present and engaged during the class at all times. I _strongly_ suggest taking notes on paper.

I except you follow the [etiquette guidelines](https://github.com/brianspiering/teaching_materials/blob/master/online_class_etiquette_guidelines.md) throughout the entire course. This is your warning. Every violation will result in a loss of participation points, negatively impacting your total grade. 

### Prework 

There will be a required prework __before__ each class. The prework is designed to make sure you are prepared for the in-class activities. For example if the in-class activity is revising your resume and you have not made a rough draft of your resume, you will get very little from the class.

Grading standards
----

The MSDS program considers a grade of "A" to represent exceptional work with respect to both the instructor's expectations and peer student achievements. I consider an "A" grade to be above and beyond what most students achieve. A grade of "B" represents the expected outcome, what is called "competence" in a business setting. A "C" grade represents achievements lower than the instructor's expectations for competence in the subject. A grade of "F" represents little or no work in the course.

I have the right, but not the obligation, to "curve" the final numerical grades at the end of the course. The mapping from percentages to letter grades (e.g., [95, 100] is an A, [90,95) is an A-, etc.) will not be established until the end of the course. Roughly, the top 15% of students will receive grades of A or A-. Roughly, 60% of students will receive grades of B+, B, or B-. Roughly, 20% of students will receive grades of C+, C, or C-. Students can receive failing grades.
