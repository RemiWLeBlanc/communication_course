__Examples of Professional Emails__:

- Read ["Email from Uber's CEO"](https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-ceo-full-email-to-employees-after-layoffs-job-cuts-2020-5). This is an excellent example of a professional email. It is one of the most difficult emails a business person has to write. Dara clearly conveys the needed information in an empathic and logical manner.  

- Read ["A Message from Co-Founder and CEO Brian Chesky"](https://news.airbnb.com/a-message-from-co-founder-and-ceo-brian-chesky/). Another example of hard-to-write but necessary email. 

- Read ["Email to former board member"](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/17tEc9ETL4tjfTmNbpwJJ5OSx1c4j10ZBgeYXWGzO30Y/mobilebasic#). Ryan Caldbeck posted this __publicly__ with the redactions.
